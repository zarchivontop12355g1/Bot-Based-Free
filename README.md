## Setting Up Environment Variables

To run this project, you don't need to expose your token directly in your code. Instead, follow these steps to set up environment variables securely:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project if it doesn't already exist.

2. In the `.env` file, add your Discord bot token in the following format:

Replace `your_bot_token_here` with your actual Discord bot token.

3. Make sure to keep your `.env` file private and never share it publicly. Add it to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits.
